# FPU Pipelined Processor Simulation

This is an educational project aimed at exploring the **pipelined architecture of processors**. In this project, the processor is described in a **structured format**.  

The project was inspired by early **mathematical coprocessors (FPUs)**, such as the **Intel 8087**, which used a **register stack** to store operands.

## Pipelined Architecture

The processor implements a pipelined architecture with the following main stages:

1. **Instruction decoding**  
2. **Operand selection**  
3. **Operation execution**  
4. **Writing results to memory**
